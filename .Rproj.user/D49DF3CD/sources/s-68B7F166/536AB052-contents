# Complete protocols {#complete-protocols}

This chapter showcases a number of complete protocols for different kinds of data visualizations. Each protocol starts with the raw data and ends with a publication quality plot. The data is available from Github, just follow [this link](https://github.com/JoachimGoedhart/DataViz-protocols/tree/main/Protocols). In the same folder you can find the R markdown files for each protocol. To reproduce the data visualizations you can either take the data and follow the instructions in the chapter. Alternatively you can download the R markdown file (and the data) and run it step by step. The R markdown files can be used as a starting point to apply the same visualization to your own data.

``` {r child = 'Protocols/protocol_1.Rmd'}
```


``` {r child = 'Protocols/protocol_2.Rmd'}
```


``` {r child = 'Protocols/protocol_3.Rmd'}
```


``` {r child = 'Protocols/protocol_4.Rmd'}
```


``` {r child = 'Protocols/protocol_5.Rmd'}
```



#### In progress {-}

This chapter is 'in progress' and I plan to add more protocols in the future.
