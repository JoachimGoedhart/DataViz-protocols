# Complete protocols {#complete-protocols}

This chapter showcases several *complete* protocols for different kinds of data visualizations. Each protocol starts with the raw data and ends with a publication quality plot. The data is available from Github in the '/data' folder on [this page](https://github.com/JoachimGoedhart/DataViz-protocols/tree/main/Protocols). The github page holds a separate Rmarkdown file for each protocol. To reproduce the data visualizations you can either take the data and follow the instructions in the chapter. Alternatively you can download the Rmarkdown file (and the data) and run it step by step. The Rmarkdown files can also be used as a starting point to apply the same visualization to your own data.

An overview of the data visualizations that are generated by the protocols:

#### In progress {.unnumbered}

This chapter is 'in progress' and I plan to add more protocols in the future.
