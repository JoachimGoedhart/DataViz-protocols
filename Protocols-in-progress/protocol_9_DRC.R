#In this protocol we visualize the data that was used to make a 'concentration reponse curve'. The data consists of some response that is a measured at different concentrations. It is usually a wide range of concentration, spanning a few orders of magnitude and often a log scale is used.
#The purpose is to measure the sensitivity of the response to the concentration. One of the relevant parameters is the 'Half maximal effective concentration' abbreviated as EC50. In this protocol we use data acquired from single cells from different biological replicates. We generate a 'superplot' to distuinguish technical and sample replicates


#Read the data:
df_DRC <- read.csv("DRC_Histamine.csv")

#Set 0 values to a 'low' value of 0.02, since we cannot plot 0 on a log10 scale that is used for the x-axis
df_DRC <- df_DRC %>% rename(Concentration=Concen) %>%
  mutate(Concentration = ifelse((Concentration == 0),
                         yes = 0.01,
                         no = Concentration)
  )

#Add a number for each replicate, based on the name of the 'Experiment' factor
df_DRC <- df_DRC %>% mutate(Replicate=as.factor(as.numeric(Experiment)))


# group by 'Experiment' and concentration to get the mean per biological replicate.
df_summary <- df_DRC %>% group_by(Concentration, Replicate) %>% summarise(mean_ERK=mean(ERKnac), mean_Akt=mean(Aktnac))


#Definethe plot of the response as a function of the concentration on the x-axis

p <-  ggplot(data = df_DRC, aes(x = Concentration, y = ERKnac)) +

#Plot the data as superplot:
p

#To label the different replicates with a colorblind friendly palette, we define a set of colors that were proposed by Paul Tol: https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/
Tol_bright <- c('#66CCEE', '#BBBBBB', '#CCBB44','#AA3377','#228833', '#4477AA')

#Try these  colors:
p <- p + scale_fill_manual(values = Tol_bright) + scale_color_manual(values = Tol_bright)

#To fit the data with nls:
fit <- nls(mean_ERK ~ top+(bot-top)/(1+(Concentration/EC50)^slope),
           data = df_summary,
           start=list(bot=-2, top=8, EC50=1, slope=1))



#To plot the fitted data, we use `augment()` function that is part of the `broom` package:
library(broom)

p + geom_line(data = augment(fit), aes(x=Concentration,y=.fitted), color="black", size=1) + scale_x_log10()


coef(fit)
paste(c("Min:", "Max:", "EC50:", "Slope:"),round(coef(fit), 1))

p + geom_smooth(data = augment(fit), aes(x=Concentration,y=.fitted), color="black", size=1) + scale_x_log10()

# to get a SINGLE CURVE with average of average Experiment:
library(drc)
p + geom_smooth(data=df_summary, aes(x = Concentration, y = mean_ERK),color='black', method = drm, method.args = list(fct = L.4()), se = FALSE)

#We have used the `drc` package to fit the data in the original paper, but I like the control that I have with the method that uses `nls()`.
