Conversions

It is possible to convert R scripts to RMarkdown format and vice versa.
To convert from an R script to Rmd (script.R -> script.Rmd), this works for me:

knitr::spin('script.R', doc = '#', precious = TRUE)


The RMarkdown file can be rendered as HTML (script.Rmd -> script.HTML) in R as follows:

rmarkdown::render("script.Rmd")
